# Applications of Compactness
This repository contains the source code for my presentation about various applications of the compactness theorem of propositional and first-order logic. Both the `beamer` and the `handout` compiled versions can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/ZeroBone/ApplicationsOfCompactness/releases).
